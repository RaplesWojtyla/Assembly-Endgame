# Assembly: Endgame (React.js + Chakra UI)

Assembly: Endgame is a charades web application that challenges players to guess randomly generated words, while managing 8 lives in the form of programming languages. Each time the player guesses incorrectly, the lives will decrease until finally only the Assembly language remains, signaling Game Lost. The app also comes with a Dark Mode feature and full support for screen reader users, ensuring an inclusive and convenient gaming experience.

## Features:
- **Random word generator**: The website generates a random word at the start of each game.
- **Lives system**: Players start with 8 lives, which decrease with each incorrect guess.
- **Dark Mode**: The website supports dark mode for a more comfortable playing experience.
- **Game reset**: Players can restart the game after itâ€™s over, allowing them to play again from the beginning.
- **Screen reader support**: The app is fully accessible for screen reader users, ensuring an inclusive experience for visually impaired players.

## Technologies:
- **React & Chakra UI**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and functionality.
